## 2. Project Architecture: Layered First File Architecture with MVC Pattern

### Overview
Edu_Chat is built following the **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** pattern, ensuring a clean separation of concerns and making the project more scalable and maintainable. The project also uses **Provider** as the state management solution and integrates Firebase services for user authentication, real-time database, and media storage.

### Architecture Breakdown

- **Model**: This layer manages the data and business logic, including interactions with Firebase Firestore and Firebase Storage.
- **View**: This layer defines the user interface using Flutter widgets, including screens for authentication, chat, and user search.
- **Controller**: Acts as the intermediary between the View and Model, handling user input, managing authentication, and ensuring real-time updates in the chat interface.

### Technologies Used
- **State Management**: Provider
- **Firebase Authentication**: Handles user sign-up, login, and logout.
- **Firestore**: Manages real-time messaging and stores user data.
- **Firebase Storage**: Used to store and retrieve media files (e.g., images).
